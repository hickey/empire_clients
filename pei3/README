pei3 - the newly rewritten Perl Empire Interface.
Written by (C) Roman M. Parparov <romm@empire.tau.ac.il>

Perl Empire Interface v3.0.0
Usage:
pei3 [-u user] [host port country player] [-d gamedir]| [game] | -n | -v | -h
Arguments: [host port country player] - supply game definitions
	 in command line
           [game] - game name as defined in ~/.pei3rc
Options: -v - print the version and exit
         -h - print this message
         -u - user string
         -n - fall to local prompt immediately
         -d - game data directory
         -f - peirc file to use instead of default ~/.pei3rc

This new version of pei revolutionarily combines readline and async
server output (something Ken was unable to do). Other than that
it is a rudimentary rewrite. It is based on Empire.pm framework.
See INSTALL file about Empire.pm package.

See 'help' command at pei command prompt about its usage.
