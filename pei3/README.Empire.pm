Instructions for installation and running of the applications using
the Empire Perl framework:

[You MUST have PERL 5.6.0 or higher!]

I. Using CPAN method:

The best way is to use the package on CPAN (http://search.cpan.org)
The module latest version is located at http://search.cpan.org/~romm/

Read the manual on CPAN on how to install modules from CPAN, it will
also ensure you will install all the prerequisites. Note that you do
not have to be root/administrator to use the CPAN system.

Then ensure the path CPAN modules are installed into is included in
your PERL running environment (see 'man perlrun' pages and PERL5LIB
environmental variable).

II. Using the modules directly:

Unpack the modules in a directory. Then include the path to Empire.pm
module in your PERL running environment (see section I) or put all
the programs using the module in the same directory Empire.pm resides.
