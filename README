		Welcome to pei - Perl Empire Interface

                *** THIS IS A BETA RELEASE ***
                ***  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK  ***

If you have never used pei before, then you should find out how to
install pei and run it by reading the file called "INSTALL".

The major changes in the upgrade from 2.8 to 2.9 are:
* pei now requires perl 5 (check your perl version with perl -v)

* pei is now fully compliant with the 'wolfpack' code.  Which of course
  broke all compliance with previous server versions.  It appears that noone
  is running pre-wolfpack games though.

You can get the lastest information and version of PEI from the PEI homepage
