        --- PEI 2.x CHANGES ---

This file records what changes were made with each version upgrade,

1.8 -> 2.0    21 Jun 95  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Replaced socket read with calles to select() and sysread()
    Replaced the pei interrupt handler
    Rewrote many functions
    Changed environment variables EMPIRECOUNTRY and EMPIREREP to
      COUNTRY and PLAYER to make it compatable with the standard client.
    I made this CHANGES entry in a rush and it is not complete.  I will
      do a more extensive and carefull job when I release 2.0.
    "history" command now accepts an argument for how many commands
      back you want to see.
    The output of all commands (except those typed at the Local% prompt)
      can now be redirected.  For example, "simu > foo" now works.
    The Empire command "exe" (short for "execute") now works.  This sends
      commands to the server directly (no alias expansion etc...) and the
      output from the server is not parsed by pei.
  local.pl
    Moved local commands into their own file

2.0 -> 2.0a   26 Jun 95  Ken Stevens
  pei
    When the user types <RETURN> pei now checks for (asynchronious) data
      from the server
    Support for the "flash" command was added.

2.0a -> 2.1   6 July 95  Ken Stevens
  pei
  sock.pl
  readline.pl
    Pei is now _fully_ asynchronous.  I consider the code to be in an
      unstable state at the moment.

2.1 -> 2.2   7 July 95  Ken Stevens
  pei
  readline.pl
    Added support for the "toggle inform" mode now available in the
      new server.  When the player types "toggle inform", then every
      time they receive a telegram from the server, then their prompt
      will instantly change to show how many telegrams are waiting for
      them to be read.
    Completely rewrote the interrupt handler (yet again...).

2.2 -> 2.3a  8 July 95  Ken Stevens
  readline.pl
    Is no more.  I couldn't find a way to get readline to work
      asynchronously, so I have abandoned it.  If you want readline and you
      don't care about asynch communication (e.g. you are playing on a
      chainsaw server) then use pei1.8 or pei2.0a.
  pei
    You now get a little beep when you get a new telegram.  If you
      don't like this, you can turn it off by setting $beep = 0 in "~/.peirc".
    Removed readline
    Completely rewrote the interrupt handler (yet again...) and tested
      about 25 different possible combinations.
    Completely rewrote all three input loops and tested extensively.

2.3p -> 2.3q  3 March 96  Ken Stevens
  example.peirc
    Fixed the "convv" alias.

2.3q -> 2.4  10 March 96  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Made pei Empire3 compatable.

2.4 -> 2.5  26 May 96  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Made pei Empire3.1 compatable.

2.5 -> 2.6  26 May 96  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Send a "sanc" back to the server if we can't login
  tools.pl
    Fixed a bug in pneweff (div by zero when no mil to build)

2.6 -> 2.7  9 Jun 96  Ken Stevens
  tools.pl
    Added "nmap" command

2.7 -> 2.8  19 Jun 96  Ken Stevens
  tools.pl
    Fixed a bug in pneweff - Laurent Fallot <Laurent.Fallot@igd.u-bordeaux.fr
    Fixed a bug in setfood - Laurent Fallot <Laurent.Fallot@igd.u-bordeaux.fr
  parse.pl
    Fixed a bug in land unit parse which affecterd artillery

2.8 -> 2.9.1 24 Apr 97  Sam Tetherow
  parse.pl
    Hacked out large parts of unused parse maps.
    Fixed and made sure everything else was running with Empire 4.0.
    Should be considered a compelete rewrite since the internal associative
     array structure changed.
  tools.pl
		fixed and tested the following tools:
			nova, xmvr, router
			tele, anno, mail, wmail
			setfood, rebel
			lneweff, pneweff, sneweff
			foreach
		The rest are untested and to be considered completly unstable (ie don't use)
2.9.1 0> 2.9.2 13 May 97  Sam Tetherow
	parse.pl
		Fixed a couple of syntax errors
	tools.pl
		Reupdated for changes in parse.pl that I missed earilier.  No new 
		functions working

	parse.pl
		Fixed more syntax errors
	tools.pl
