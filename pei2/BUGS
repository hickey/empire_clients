        --- Known bugs in pei ---

This should no longer be an issue with the move to perl5.  If you are still
having problems send me mail.
#	"Protocol not supported"
#		If you see this message, edit sock.pl and change
#			sub SOCK_STREAM       { 1; }
#		to
#			sub SOCK_STREAM       { 2; }

"Command not found"
  If you get "Command not found" when you type "pei", try typing "perl pei"
or "./pei".

XRIX (IRIX?)
  simu.pl doesn't load (perl doesn't like the sort syntax).  Solution:
  remove the lines:
          eval("package $game; do 'simu.pl';");
          &nofind_error("simu.pl",$@) if !$simu_loaded;
  from the file called "pei" and try again.

SunOS
  Sometimes perl (for example in SunOS) is unable to find the files
  tools.pl, parse.pl, ...
  In this case, put all the *.pl files in a directory called ~/perl and
  then in your ~/.login file put the line:
  setenv PERLLIB ~/perl

"router"
  Router doesn't seem to behave as it should.  For example, if you
  have two warehouses on the same island, and half of the sectors dist
  to one warehouse, and half to the other, then "router" will apparently
  switch which warehouse the sectors dist to.  Very strange (I'll have
  to see it to believe it!).  Hopefully (but unlikely) I'll have time to
  test it on a blitz sometime.
