  These are things which we hope to add to pei in the future:

  Update in progress
    Check for "Update in progress" message in robot tools.  (Mainly
    useful for blitzing.)

  Rewrite of entire client to move to a 'packagable' structure which will
  facilitate the writing of modules for different capabilites.  Most notably
  a TK module or a curses module for client interface.  This could also be
  used to group tools into 'logical' blocks and then you would only need to
  include the tools you use.
