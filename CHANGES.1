        --- PEI 1.x CHANGES  ---

This file records what changes were made with each version upgrade.

1.0 -> 1.0.1     28 Jun 94   Ken Stevens
  Rewrote eval { } and x77 so that it will work under older versions of perl.
  Added a 'bye' command.
  Moved stuff users don't need to know out of pei.man and into hacker.man.
  Fixed readline.pl so that it should now work on all systems.
  Fixed local prompt so that it now works without readline.pl.
  Fixed interrupt handler for the local prompt.

1.0.1 -> 1.0.2   29 Jun 94   Ken Stevens
  Fixed a bug in 'addgame' and 'games' which removed dots from hostnames.
  Changed addgame to allow any number of whitespace characters to separate
    fields (rather than insisting on space separated fields).

1.0.2 -> 1.0.3   30 Jun 94   Ken Stevens
  Fixed a serious bug in buildcost which caused router and cmvr to
    not work correctly.
  Fixed router.
  Fixed cmvr <THRESH> and umvr <THRESH> to use the <THRESH> argument.
  Fixed nova <SECTS> to use the <SECTS> argument.

1.0.3 -> 1.0.4   27 Jul 94   Ken Stevens
  Fixed a bug which resulted in the subroutine &main'ECONNREFUSED sometimes
    being undefined.  It is now guaranteed to be defined.
  Fixed a bug which broke the ?scommand syntax--you can now safely use
    ?scommand syntax in your aliases.
  Fixed a bug which translated:
      alias sct "dump ${1:-#} ${2:+junk} | psect | more"
    incorrectly (when translating from .eifrc to .peirc).
  Fixed a bug in readline !history mechanism (if you typed <CR> at a sub-prompt
    then the empire command was not being put on the history list--now fixed).
  Added $AUTOGAME capability.
  Added support for environment variables EMPIRECOUNTRY, EMPIREREP, EMPIREHOST,
    and EMPIREPORT.
  Now permit ~/dir syntax for directories in "addgame" command.
  Can now just type "pei gamename" at the unix prompt.
  Added new local command: "terse" which toggles whether tools have
    long or short output (useful for people with 1200 or 2400 baud modems).
  Added new local command "quiet" to toggle the value of $quiet.
  Improved xmvr algorithm to make it much faster (once a sector has spent
    all its mob, it now is deleted from the @rich array speeding things
    up considerably).
  Fixed the spelling of "interrupt" in all files.
  Added four interrupt handlers: one for each tool.
  Made a new file "BUGS".

1.0.4 -> 1.0.5   27 Jul 94   Ken Stevens
  Fixed a bug which threw pei into an infinite loop when ^C was hit
    during an attack.
  Improved interrupt handler diagnostics.

1.0.5 -> 1.1.0   11 Aug 94   Sam Tetherow
  tools.pl:
    Added three new tools: "sneweff", "pneweff", and "lneweff" which
      calculate the new efficiency ships, planes, and land units will
      have after the update (based on commodities and avail).
    Added two new tools: "tele" and "anno" which let you use an
      editor to compose your telegrams and announcements, and then
      pei chops it into 1024 byte blocks and sends it off for you.
    Added two new tools: "mail" and "wmail" which are mail-like
      interfaces for reading your telegrams and announcements with reply,
      forward, and save capabilities (telegrams and announcements are saved
      in separate files in the users game directory, with messages marked
      as "read" or "unread").
    Added a "foreach" tool which allows you to perform an Empire command on a
      specified group of sectors.
    Rewrote find_country_number to use nation vs relation 1, relation 2, 
      and country *.

  pei:
    &find_country_number and &tools_init now occur before the reading
      of startup.exec.  It is no longer necessary to put $coun=X in
      your startup.exec file.
    eval(''.&quotify(...)) was removed from country name and
      representative to allow users (like Drazz'zt) to have non-alphanumeric
      characters in their country name and rep.  If $game is set from $country
      and $country contains non-alphanumeric characters, as much of $country
      as possible is used for the game name ($game must be alphanumeric
      because it is used as a package name).

  parse.pl:
    Removed all occurances of %parse_vars and moved the info that was
      in %parse_vars to comments at the top of parse.pl organised
      according to sect, country, unit, etc.
    Moved all calls to &add_parsemap to the top.
    Rewrote &parse_map.
    Fixed parsing for:
      ships, units, planes, sonar, lookout, llookout, coastwatch, spy, report,
      Bulletins, attack, relations, satellite, recon, mission query, build, map
      resource, country,
    Added functions &dump_info and &load_info which save and
      load unowned sector and unit data (so that enemy intelligence
      from spying, llook, etc... is saved over logging out and in
      again).  The data is saved in a file called $game.dump.  This
      functionality is currently not used.

1.1.0 -> 1.1.1   13 Aug 94   Ken Stevens
    Changed the name of README to INSTALL and made README now include
      information that users of older versions of pei will want to know.
    Moved "wish list" out of hacker.man and into a file called WISH_LIST.
    Copied the tool manual into a file called tools.man.
    I now run an integrity checking program which ensures that all
      repeated documentation is identical.
    Added "help tools" command.
    Fixed a bug in history which caused !abc to not work sometimes.
    Game names are now forced to be alphanumeric.
    Removed &getline from pei and renamed &drazz_getline to &getline
      in tools.pl.
    Fixed "games" command so that country and rep are not
      eval-quotify'd (since they aren't when they are specified).
    Added user definable variable $EDITOR for specifying which editor
      to use when composing telegrams.
    Fixed a bug in tele which prevented you from having blank lines in
      telegrams.  Also added "Sending telegram...done" diagnostics.
    Changed pei so that now you can just put the *.pl files in the
      same directory as pei (they don't have to be in ~/perl anymore).
    Fixed the decimal formatting for xneweff functions.
    Fixed interrupt handers for routines which read data from the server.
    Added "rebel" command.

1.1.1 -> 1.1.2   18 Aug 94   Ken Stevens
   Completely rewrote all the mail/wmail stuff and put it in a new file
      called mail.pl.
   Now pei screams warnings at you if it can't find the tools it needs.
   Sam fixed a couple of bugs related to avail calculation in pneweff
      and lneweff.

1.1.1 -> 1.1.3   20 Aug 94   Sam Tetherow
    Fixed parse_produce.
    Added realm parsing to parse_nation.
    Added in_realm to tools.pl:
      in_realm($realmstring, $sect) will return 1 if $sect is in $realmstring,
      0 otherwise.  ($realmstring is of type x1:x2,y1:y2)
    Added two new tools "delta" and "cdelta":

1.1.3 -> 1.1.3a  11 Sep 94   Ken Stevens
  pei:
    The role of "startup.exec" has changed.  It no longer contains
      commands sent to the server which are required by the tools.  These
      commands are now automatically and silently run when the tools are
      loaded.  The name of "startup.exec" has changed to "start.exec" and
      should now only contain commands which the user wants to run when they
      connect to the game (for example, maybe you want to display a map
      and check for starvation everytime you logon, so you could put "map #"
      and "starv *" in your start.exec file.
  tools.pl:
    Changed &find_country_number so that it can find your country
      number in the old server, the new server, or a HIDDEN game.
    Fixed interrupt handler for "nova" tool.
    Stuff that used to be in "startup.exec" is now in &tools_init.
  mail.pl:
    Now keeps "You lost your capitol..." messages out of mail.
  parse.pl:
    Changed &parse_nation so that it can work with either the old or
      the new server. 

1.1.3a -> 1.2    12-15 Sep 94   Sam Tetherow
  tools.pl
    Added 7 new tools: stat, sstat, lstat, pstat, delta, wdelta, fdelta

  parse.pl
    Added parse_level
    Added lcargo (in parse_cargo)
    Added parse_power
    Misc fixes to parse_prod and others.
    Added &main'load_DB and &main'save_DB to load and store the internal DB.
      (Called from pei.)
  pei
  Added call to &main'load_DB to occur immediately following the loading of
   tools.pl and parse.pl
  Added call to &main'save_DB to occur both in do_exit and shutdown.  I am not
   sure if there are the best places to put them, but that is what it looked 
   like to me.
  Fixed ^C during wait

                 13-15 Sep 94   Ken Stevens
  readline.pl
    Upgraded from version 930122.003 to version 930306.007 of readline.pl.
  pei
    Fixed the way readline.pl handles cursor movement (007 does it nicer)
    Removed $, = ", " from pei because it conflicted with readline.pl
    I moved &getline out of pei and into tools.pl and mail.pl.
    You can now call pei with a "-n" flag which means "don't load
      tools".  The idea here is to speed up the connection time if you just
      want to login and check your mail in a game.
    Changed load_DB and save_DB so that each game has its own copy and
      save_DB is called for each connected game at shutdown time.
  mail.pl
    Fixed a bug in headers which wrote "30" for the subject of BULLETINS
    Now if a message is >22 lines it will be piped to more.
  tools.pl
    Created a function &print_n_parse which prints a command to the
      screen and then parses it.  It is used for the init commands.
    The foreach tool has been changed so that anything appearing after the
      sector specification is parsed as an input line rather than as
      an empire command.  Thus it can now contain semicolons and aliases.
1.2 -> 1.2.1   16 Sep 94 Ken & Sam
  pei
    Fixed a bug which caused pei to seg fault when shutting down.
  tools.pl
    Fixed a bug which miscalculated co-ordinate wrapping and screwed
      up stat.
  parse.pl
    Fixed a bug in save_DB which separated first three fields by ','
      by mistake.
1.2.1 -> 1.2.2  16 Sep 94  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Moved parsing of local commands after file redirection so that
      people can do stuff like "alias >! my_aliases" and "games >! mygames".
    Fixed alias recursion.  There was a bug which caused aliases like
      alias info "info | more"
      alias power "power new | more"
      --to result in infinite loops when the user typed "info" or "power".
      The bug has been fixed.
  parse.pl
    Added parsing of %wkfc to &parse_produce.
  tools.pl
    Made a new tool called "extra" which will tell you how many extra
      civs you have in a sector.  For example, if you had:

  sect  des eff wkfc will make- p.e. cost  use1 use2 use3  max1 max2 max3  max
  6,2    i 100%  590   31 shell 0.31 $300  200l 100h       236l 118h      36
  5,3    t 100%  590 4.43 tech  0.74 $1800   6d  30o  60l   22d 110o 220l 16.26

      --then if you type "extra" in pei, you would get:
You have  69 extra civs in 6,2.
You have 330 extra civs in 5,3.

1.2.2 -> 1.2.3  6 Oct 94   Ken Stevens & Sam Tetherow
  tools.pl
    Fixed a bug in "delta" which wiped out the enemy sector database.
    Added <SECTS> argument to most tools, and changed the way that
      <SECTS> argument is processed.
    stat/sstat/pstat/lstat now allow arguments like ?own=Mirkwood.
    Added "relations" command to startup stuff for above change.
    Changed find_country_number to use "change country" to find the
      country number (this is much much faster).
    Completely rewrote tools_extra and called it tools_civs.
    Changed &print_n_parse to include the >/dev/null redirection.
    Put &print_n_parse in all places it could go.
    Fixed a bug which caused problems when you were country #0.
    Improved the stat algorithm to make it much faster (looping over
      known sectors rather than all sectors in realm.)
  parse.pl
    Added parse_change (for &find_country_number).
    Changed &parse_produce to &parse_product.
    "march" and "nav" are now parsed by parse_look.
    Fixed a bug in parse_produce which caused new guns not to appear
      on the "delta" report.
  pei
    Improved the error message you get when a tool doesn't load.
    Fixed a bug in &quotify which was removing ' symbols from the
      middle of commands.
  mail.pl
    Fixed a bug in &getline which ate spaces at the beginning of lines.

1.2.3 -> 1.2.4  12 Oct 94  Ken Stevens
  tools.pl
    Added three new tools:
      reach       - Tells you the range of your forts, radar stations, and 
                    coastwatch.
      sreach <SHIPS>
                  - Tells you the fire range of your ships, and how many
                    sectors they can nav this update and next update.
      lreach <UNITS>
                  - Tells you the fire range of your land units, and how many
                    100% (non-road non-mountain) sectors they can march this
                    update and next update.
    Changed the "civs" tool to include uw's and mil in sector workforce
      and changed the name of the "civs" column to "workforce".
    Fixed a bug in wdelta which gave empty deltas when there were
      multiple dist centres (Sam made this fix).
    Added "show ship stats" and "show land stats" to startup sequence
      for the "sreach" and "lreach" tools.
    Renamed &build_target &build_sect_target.
  parse.pl
    Added parse of "Technology factor" in &parse_nation for use in "reach".
    Fixed a bug in &parse_land_stats.
  mail.pl
    You are now allowed to reply to telegrams ("BULLETINS") from the deity.
  pei
    Rewrote "help tools" to make things more clear.

1.2.4 -> 1.3  22 Oct 94  Ken Stevens & Sam Tetherow & Drake Diedrich
  RCS
    pei is now being maintained using RCS.  An idea who's time had come.
  tools.pl
    Added three new tools:
    jack <SECTS>  - Set iron thresholds in your "j" and "k" sectors to the
                    value of "max1" in your production report.  After calling
                    "jack", you can call "imvr" to move iron into the sectors
                    that need it.
    fus <SHIPS>   - Fuel ships in harbours and generate an error message if
                    the harbour needs more fuel.
    cmap <REALM>  - Like bmap, but prints a letter representing the owner of
                    sectors not owned by you, so you can see who is where.
    Added &init_letter, &toupper, &tolower for 'cmap' tool.
    Modified xmvr to have a sects argument.  New syntax is:
      xmvr <SECTS> <THRESH>.  Note that if you want to specify <THRESH>, you
      must also specify <SECTS>.
    Changed the 'civs' tools to show extra civs and uw's separately.
    Fixed 'civs' tools to show civs needed in the case when a sector
      is being redesignated.
    The tools "sstat", "pstat", and "lstat" now print the country name
      rather than the country number.
    The tools "stat", "sstat", "pstat", and "lstat" will now generate
      an error message if they are called incorrectly.
    Fixed a division by zero bug in the "reach" tool (now it prints
      "infinity" for the tech required for the highest ranges).
    Fixed a minor bug in sneweff (actually in build_ships) which
      showed commodities being used at sea.
    Put #' all over the place to make it emacs friendly.
    Removed the if (!$tools_loaded) bracketting the external tools.
  pei
    Added $, = ", " to &init so that when you print arrays in pei you
      can read them.
    "user" is now sent before "coun" in &connect to prevent an error
      log at the server end.
    Pei now reads 'sys/socket.ph' if it's available and uses it in the
      call to socket (this is required by the Solaris operating system).
    Created a new local command "reload" for reloading tools.pl and
      parse.pl.  It is mainly for Sam and I who need to reload these files
      on the fly as we work on them.  This is a "debugging" tool so I
      won't add it to the pei docs.  
  parse.pl
    Fixed a bug in &parse_look, &parse_spy_plane, and &parse_attack
      which wasn't remembering that you saw approx 0 mil in a sector.
    Fixed a bug in &load_DB which wasn't loading both parts of the date.
    Fixed a bug in &parse_nation which misparsed realms.
    Added parse of tech decay rate to &parse_version.
    Changed &parse_product to match lines from start to finish.
    Added &parse_realm.
  readline.pl
    In SetTTY, replaced $TIOCSETP with $TIOCSETN to allow typeahead in pei.
  hacker.man
    Updated this file.

1.3 -> 1.4     2 Nov 94   Ken Stevens & Kevin O'Connor
  tools.pl
    Added a new command:
      crew <SHIPS>  - This command specifies exactly how many civs or mil your
                      ships will need so that they won't decay when they are
   	              out at sea.  (Note this might not be 100% accurate
                      on all servers.)
    Modified three commands:
      fus <SHIPS>     - If the ship is at sea, and it is not completely
                        fueled, then 'fus' will show the number of sectors
                        (and updates) it will be able to sail before
                        needing to refuel.  'fus' will also now list ships
                        stranded at sea.
      sneweff <SHIPS> - Added a new "total" line at the bottom which tells
                        you the total amount of commodities consumed in
                        the sector for building.  Any extra commodities in the
                        sector (i.e. not being used for building) are preceded
                        by a +.  this is helpful if you might need to use the
                        commodities elsewhere.
      lneweff <UNITS> - Changed in the same way as sneweff.
    Fixed a bug in the 'jack' tool--it was only jacking thresholds in
      'k' sectors (*blush*).
    Fixed a bug in 'reach' tool which was neglecting to add 1 to fort range.
    If &find_country_number is not able to find your country number,
      then it will ask you for it (since "change c" won't work if you don't
      have enough BTU's).
  pei (These changes were made by Kevin O'Connor)
    Pei now checks for environment variables EDITOR and PAGER and uses
      them if it finds them.  $EDITOR and $PAGER may also be set in .peirc.
    Fixed a bug in the interrupt handler which wouldn't let you out of pei
      if you weren't able to flush server output because of lag.
  mail.pl (These changes were made by Kevin O'Connor)
    If the user puts "$mailflag = 1" in either .peirc or start.exec, then
      when the player uses the "mail" and "wmail" commands, the teles and
      annos will not be deleted on the server.  This is most useful for 
      co-rulers.
    To facilitate this, new headers are compared with old headers
      when $mailflag is set, to avoid duplicate telegrams in the teles file.

1.4  -> 1.4.1  7 Nov 94  Ken Stevens
  pei
    Fixed socket stuff so that pei will work on IRIX machines.  It
      seems that IRIX machines require that you write to a socket before you
      can read from it.
    If you typed "pei badgamename" in unix, you got the cryptic error message
      "Cannot assign requested address."  This has been changed to a
      "Usage:"... error message.
  tools.pl
    Changed "stat" tools so that they specify the month name instead
      of a number in the date column.
  parse.pl
    Added array %monthname for stat functions.
    Fixed spelling of agribusiness (was screwing up "stat" tool).

1.4.1 -> 1.5  12 Nov 94  Ken Stevens
  pei
    If pei gets a "Socket protocol not supported" error the first time
      it runs, then it will modify itself to fix the problem and ask you to
      run it again.  Hopefully this will solve any pei socket problems on
      most machines. 
  tools.pl
    Changed the "rebel" command so that it now shows sectors which
      have "too much" mil in them so that you can move mil around to prevent
      rebellion.  "rebel" will now also show sector designation and mobility.
    "lneweff" will now only check land units in '!' or 'f' sectors.

1.5 -> 1.6  15 Dec 94  Ken Stevens
  mail.pl
    Fixed a bug in "anno" and "tele" tool which would delete a line of
      your text from time to time.  The problem was that pei was forgetting
      to count the \n when calculating the length of a line.
  parse.pl
    Changed split(/ / to split(/[ \n]+/ in &parse_dump.  Apparently
      this only affected the parsing of rads.
    There was an infinite loop in &parse_bulletin which was causing
      pei to hang when parsing plane output when it didn't know the
      country number for a country.  The loop now terminates.
  pei
    If you put "$debug=1" in ~/.peirc, then pei will display the login
      conversation between pei and the server when it connects to a game.
  tools.pl
    The "setfood" tool will now not set food thresholds in warehouses.
    find_country_number now sets $number{$country} to $coun.
    In "pneweff" tool, added "total", "extra", and "needs".
    Changed "fus" so that it now tells you when your ship is in an
      ally's harbour and how far it can go from there before running
      out of fuel.  Also fixed a bug which didn't notice petrol in the
      sector (it was spelled "pet" when it should have been spelled "petrol".)
    Changed "xmvr" so that you're now allowed to move commodities (not
      civs and uw's) out from (but not into) a sector if you're not
      the old owner of the sector.  For example, feeding civs from a
      conquered warehouse. 
    Changed $minmob (the minimum allowed mobility for a sector for
      xmvr) for harbours from 10 to 40.  The reason is that you need
      mobility in harbours when feeding your civs using fishing boats.
1.6 -> 1.7  Ken Stevens, Jorg Schray, and Chris Farrell
  mail.pl
    Added new variable $mailflag{"gamename"} which does the same thing
      as $mailflag (keeps the mail on the server when you use the "mail" 
      tool), except you now have the possibility to set the mail flag
      on some games but not others. (Jorg Schray)
  pei
    Ported pei to perl5.000.  Note that it still works under perl4.x.
      (Jorg Schray)
    Added a new local command "firewall" to allow players stuck behind
      a firewall to use a proxy server to connect to an Empire server.
      Type "help local" from within pei for more details. (Chris Farrell)
    Documented that "a" in the "make" field of the "simu" tool refers
      to how much avail will be produced in that sector.
  readline.pl
    Jorg Schray also needed to change readline.pl in a number of
      places to get it to compile under perl5.000.

  simu.pl
    Got a new version of simu.pl from Drake which calculates avail better.
    Applied a patch from Steven White which alligns the columns better.
  parse.pl
    Bugfix from Jorg Schray <schrayj@lvu.ph.lancs.ac.uk> in perl5, "undef"
      only takes one arg.
  readline.pl
    Fixed reverse-search (patch from Drake).
  tools.pl
    Fixed a bug in sneweff which was giving the wrong info for ships
      at sea (I think that I screwed up the last time I fixed this,
      but now my present fix looks better...)
    Now x,y will line up at the , in sneweff, lneweff, and pneweff.  Suggested
      by Steven A White <sa2white@calum.csclub.uwaterloo.ca>.
    Fixed a bug (reported by m_turner@cs.wisc.edu (Michael Turner)) which
      was parsing "5 ships", "4 planes", ... at the bottom of "ship *"
      parsing, and thus generating some erroneous reports.
    Changed some multiple undef commands into single undef's for perl5.
